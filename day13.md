## Section 9: Let's Build a Framework / Library!

The lectures were more of a code along and less of a theoretical knowledge.

Created a new library which would utilize the jQuery like methods to give greeting messages for Spanish and English languages.

The project majorly utilized the concepts of immediately invoked function expressions, function expressions, default object values, chain able methods, setting up prototype methods, aliasing functions and adding it to the global variables and so on..

Keeping meaningful comment on the code-base is always good idea.
