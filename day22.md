# Section 4: Types in JavaScript

## 63. Type Coercion

When an operation is done between 2 different data types.

It includes the language converting a data type into another one.

Mostly dynamic languages are having type coercion. In JavaScript it’s heavily happens.

## 54. JTS: Dynamic vs Static Typing

Each domain has own suited language.

JavaScript is dynamically typed languages.

With dynamic language, we don’t have to declare a variable specifically while for static languages, it’s mandatory.

In dynamic languages, type checking is happened in runtime.

Static languages comes with lesser bugs as compared to dynamic languages but makes the project more complex and has extra development process.

## 55. JTS: Weakly vs Strongly Typed

JavaScript is weakly typed dynamic language while Python is strongly typed dynamic language.

Due to type coercion, it’s weakly typed and it allows to perform operations between 2 different data types like adding string and number data types.

In strongly typed languages type coercion, is more stronger and doesn’t allows to add the different data types.

## 56. JTS: Static Typing In JavaScript

Using static type checkers are also the another option like flow. It checks everything and works with babel. It comes out of the box with flow.

Typescript is the best way to make JavaScript static.

Typescript is superset of the JavaScript. It has own compiler which will convert Typescript to JavaScript.

Static typing is good for largely expanding projects.
