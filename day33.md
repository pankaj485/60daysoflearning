# Section 8: OOP vs FP

## 134. Composition vs Inheritance

Inheritance is a super class which is extended to smaller pieces which extends the functionality of it using extends.

Composition is using smaller pieces to create something bigger.

OOP focuses more on inheritance while functional programming focuses more on composition.

## 135. OOP vs FP

All the related notes are already updated in the previous lectures.

Both of them have different fundamental way to solve the solutions.

All it matters is how you implement the code in better solution.

JavaScript offers both way of implementations.

## 136. OOP vs FP

Functional programming is performing many operations for which the data is fixed. OOP is is about performing few operations on common data.

Functional programming is stateless while OOP is stateful

In functional programming, functions are pure and doesn’t have side effects while in OOP the methods has side effects.

Functional programming is more declarative while OOP is more imperative.

Functional programming is good for analyzing large data while if there are few things which requires a lot of functions applied to it then functional programming is the way while many things are there but may not require a lot of operations then it could be better to go with OOP.

Both can be used at the same time based on the requirement. It all depends on how the data and behavior is to be handled.

OOP is more inclined to getting data and behavior in a single place which makes it more readable and organized. But with functional programming, it’s opposite and is more inclined towards the separating both from one another.
