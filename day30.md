# Section 7: Functional Programming

## 120. Indempotent

Given the same input to the function, it should always return the same output when executed over and over.

It ensures code predictability

## 121. Imperative vs Declarative

Imperative: Tells machine what to do and how to do it.

Declarative: Tell machine what to do and what should happen but not how to do it.

Machine codes are more imperatives while high level codes are more declarative.

Declarative codes eventually has to be imperative eventually.

## 122. Immutability

Is concept of not changing state but making copy of the state and returning a new state every time.

Mutating is changing of the data.
